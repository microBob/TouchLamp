# TouchLamp
A light source and show... without buttons!

# What is this
The TouchLamp is a desktop lamp that uses capacitive sensors instead of buttons.
Each of the three buttons (in this case I used aluminum foil) is connected to the microcontroller.

# What the three buttons do
The left button starts a program that makes the five LEDs brighten itself in order (left ot right) then back down.
The center button [digitally] turns on and off all LEDs at the same time.
The right button launches a application/program that makes the three center LEDs change their brightness according to the brightness.
